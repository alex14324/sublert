## What's this about?
Sublert is a security and reconnaissance tool that was written in Python to leverage certificate transparency for the sole purpose of monitoring new subdomains deployed by specific organizations and issued TLS/SSL certificate. The tool is supposed to be scheduled to run periodically at fixed times, dates, or intervals (Ideally each day). New identified subdomains will be sent to Slack workspace with a notification push. Furthermore, the tool performs DNS resolution to determine working subdomains.

## Requirements
- Virtual Private Server (VPS) running on Unix. (I personally use digitalOcean)
- Python 2.x or 3.x.
- Free Slack workspace.
